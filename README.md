## Backgroud
All have faced a situation where we would like to have the ability to search through a video to just a particular segment of interest or search through our video archive to find a few specific moments. This project intends to create a search engine that will allow video segment search.Â 

For this to be possible, the videos need to be enriched with metadata. Metadata is not just the date, location and rich description but also a transcript of the video. If we could annotate any object, Text, or signs that appear in the videos, we could search for specific moments when they occur.

In the project, the [pycode](https://github.com/maaparna/CourseProject/tree/main/pycode) folder has the following python files:
-[jsonCreation.py](https://github.com/maaparna/CourseProject/blob/main/pycode/jsonCreation.py) 
-[LabelSearch.py](https://github.com/maaparna/CourseProject/blob/main/pycode/LabelSearch.py)

[jsonCreation.py](https://github.com/maaparna/CourseProject/blob/main/pycode/jsonCreation.py) can be used to annotate the videos stored in the cloud and to upload the resulting json file back to cloud.It uses the Google video intelligence API to annotate the videos. 

[LabelSearch.py](https://github.com/maaparna/CourseProject/blob/main/pycode/LabelSearch.py) uses the json file along with streamlit.io to produce an application that allows to search segments of the videos using the generated labels.


## Installation
